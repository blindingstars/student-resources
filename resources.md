#### Identifying Themes

* [What WP Theme Is That?](http://whatwpthemeisthat.com/)
* [WP Theme Detector](http://www.wpthemedetector.com/)

#### Choosing Themes

* [Evaluating responsive WordPress themes](https://thethemefoundry.com/blog/responsive-wordpress-themes/)
* [What To Consider When Choosing A WordPress Theme](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/12/what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-wordpress-theme/)
* [Are You Getting Cheated When Buying A WordPress Theme?](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/ripped-off-buying-wordpress-themes/) The theme we started out with seemed very good, offering speeds that were quite good, especially for a news website or portal. We tested the theme with demo content; however, regardless of how hard we tried, speeds and scores never reached those on the vendor’s website. This led us to believe that theme vendors sometimes set up demos to make their websites appear faster than they really are. So, the question is, when we shop for a theme, do we get what’s on the tin?
